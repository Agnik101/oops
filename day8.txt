Assignment
Stream: CSE (DS)
1. Create an abstract class "ThreeDObject". The class "ThreeDObject" has two abstract
methods"surfaceArea()" and "volume()". Declare classes "Box", "Cube", "Cylinder" and "Cone"
as subclasses of "ThreeDObject". In main method create objects of "Cube", "Cylinder" and
"Cone" and print the "surfaceArea()" and "volume()" of all the shapes.
2. Create an interface “College” containing attributes CollegeName and CollegeCode. It also has
abstract method display(). Create a class “Department” containing attributes deptName,
DeptHead. The class contains methods for accepting and displaying member variables . Then
write “Student” class extending “Department” class and implementing “College” interface. This
class contains attributes studentName, regNo, and avgMarks. Write a driver class to test the
“Student” class. Print all the details of the student.
3. Create a class Student in package p1. Student has data members name and roll_no. Write
appropriate method to read input and display output. Create subclass Marks (marks is not in p1)
consisting of marks of 3 different subjects. Display name, roll_no and marks of each individual
student.
4. In a triangle, the sum of two sides is greater than the third. If we are given three values a, b ,c
then
a+b>c
b+c>a
c+a>b
Write a class Triangle which throw an exception of type TriangleException (user defined
exception) if any one of the above conditions are not satisfied else evaluate the area of a
triangle and display the output.
