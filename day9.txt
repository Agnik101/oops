1. Define a class, MyThread, by implementing Runnable interface and create 3
threads with the max priority, min priority and average priority. Each of the threads
will display 1 to 5, and there will be a sleep of 2s between each of the display.
2. Define a class, MyClass, by inheriting Thread class and create 4 threads with
random priority in the range of 1...5. Update a counter for 10 milliseconds in each
of the threads. In these threads, priority will be increased by 1, 2, 2, 1,
respectively in every 30 millisecond. Print the priority and the value of counter for
each threads in every 10 milliseconds.
