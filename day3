1. Write a program to implement prefix and postfix increment and
decrement operator overloading on a data member of a class.
2. Write a program to create a class Vector with data member *arr,
where arr is a pointer to a vector. Use dynamic memory allocation for
this vector. Implement Assignment Operator ( = ) overloading to
assign one vector into another.
3. Create a class Matrix with two data members row and column.
Use dynamic memory allocation for two dimension array and
then perform matrix multiplication using operator overloading.

4. WAP in C++ to create a class String1 which has a character
array. a) Concatenate two strings by overloading ‘+’ operator.
b) Check equality of two strings by overloading ‘==’ operator.
