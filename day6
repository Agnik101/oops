1. Write a program to implement multiplication of two matrices using Java.
2. Write a program in Java which uses three command-line arguments to initialize an array.
When the program executes, if args.length is not 3, the program prints an error message and

terminates. Otherwise ,it initializes and displays the array based on the values of the command-
line arguments. The args[ 0 ] specifies the array size, args[ 1 ] and args[ 2 ] are initial value

and increment respectively. Calculate the value for each array element.
3. i)Write a program in Java to create a class called “Box” which contains three variables –
width, height and length. Set the values of the variables using constructor overloading, and
also use a method “volume” which returns the volume of the box.From main function call the
volume function of the class and print the volume.
ii) Write a method called “equals” in the “Box” class. “equals” method has only one parameter
of type Box. Use this function to check whether two boxes are identical or not.
4. Create a class called “time” in Java which will have three private data members viz hour,
minute and second and also a method name “add” which will take one “time” object as
parameter and print the added value of the calling “time” object and passed “time” object. In
the main function declare two “time” objects and assign values using the constructor and call
the “add” method.
